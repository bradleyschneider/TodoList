# TodoList
Created a to-do list that lists tasks you need to complete or things you want to do and in our design [Todo List App], there is a content box that holds only the input field with some buttons and text. When you entered some characters and click on the plus (+) button, the list will be added to your tasks list and the number of the pending tasks also be updated.

You can also delete each list by clicking on the trash icon, and remember this trash icon only appear on hover on the particular list and delete all tasks with a single click.
